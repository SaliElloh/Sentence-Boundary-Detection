# Sentence-Boundary-Detection
Utilizing the Decision Tree Classifier, the project focuses on the binary classification of whether a period "." is categorized as an "End of Sentence" or "Not End of Sentence." 

# Introduction

This project focuses on Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) through the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier. It leverages a set of features to distinguish between periods that signify the end of a sentence and those that do not. Additionally, the program explores the efficacy of various feature combinations, providing insights into the impact of feature selection on classification accuracy.

# Example Input/Output

Example Input:
"Mr. Smith went to the store. He bought a bag of apples."

Example Output:

Period after "Mr." classified as "Not End of Sentence"
Period after "store" classified as "End of Sentence"

# Pseudocode Explanation
The program employs a series of data preprocessing steps and the Decision Tree Classifier to achieve Sentence Boundary Detection. Key components of the pseudocode include:

Data preprocessing via Test_Preprocess.py and Train_Preprocess.py to remove extraneous characters and labels.
Training and testing using the Decision Tree Classifier (SBD.py) with varying feature combinations. These features include:
   1. Int(log(count(R, is lower))):
   feature essentially calculates the logarithm of the count of lowercase characters (spaces) for the word on the right.
   2. left_context.count('.'):
   This feature counts the number of times the period occurs in the left word.
   3. count(period, R):
   This feature counts the occurrences of periods in the right word.
   4. Word to the left of “.” (L):
   Captures the preceding word before the period to understand its context.
   5. Word to the right of “.” (R):
   Identifies the following word after the period to establish its relationship.
   6. Length of L < 3:
    Checks if the preceding word's length is less than 3 characters, aiding in boundary identification.
   7. Is L capitalized:
   Determines if the word to the left is capitalized, providing insights into capitalization patterns.
   8. Is R capitalized:
   Examines whether the word to the right is capitalized, contributing to the analysis of capitalization usage.
   Creation of SBD.test.out to provide a summary of test word classifications.

# Conclusion
The analysis of the system's performance underscores the importance of feature selection. While accuracy generally improves with an increased number of features, a more nuanced understanding is revealed by evaluating precision, recall, and F1 score. This comprehensive assessment allows for a more informed judgment of the system's effectiveness.
